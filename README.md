## Overview
The main purpose of this repository is to provide the resources needed to build the low cost rover (<500€) to perform tests related to robotic autonomy.

Required software:
Eagle: Software to design PCB.
Arduino IDE: The open platform is based on an Arduino
Matlab 2016b: The platform includes a computer (NUC) that executes a Matlab Simulink diagram to perform motions.
