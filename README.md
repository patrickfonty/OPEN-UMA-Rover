## Overview
The OpenUmaRov is an open source mobile robotic platform that allows anyone to build it with a maximum cost of 500€. The platform is based on commercial components that can be adcquired by Internet. This project involves students and researchers to improve the development of the platform. Moreover, it can be used for teaching and research activities that involves mechanical, engineering, software, electronics and robotics.

Required software:
Eagle: Software to design PCB.
Arduino IDE: The open platform is based on an Arduino
Matlab 2016b: The platform includes a computer (NUC) that executes a Matlab Simulink diagram to perform motions.

## Rover prototype

The current version of the rover is shown in the following images. An experiment was carried out to demonstrate the rover is able to move indoor and outdoor.
